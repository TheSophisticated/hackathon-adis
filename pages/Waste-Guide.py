    Organic waste can be composted at home or in a community composting program. Composting turns food scraps, yard waste, and other organic materials into nutrient-rich soil amendment. Some examples of organic waste include:

    * Food scraps: Fruit and vegetable peels, cores, and seeds; meat, poultry, and fish bones; dairy products; coffee grounds and tea bags; eggshells; bread and pasta scraps.

    * Yard waste: Grass clippings, leaves, twigs, and branches; flowers and plants; garden trimmings.

    * Other organic materials: Paper towels and napkins; cardboard boxes and containers; coffee filters; tea bags.

    # Best practices for composting organic waste:

    * Chop up larger items: This will help them decompose more quickly.
    * Add a variety of materials: Include both green (nitrogen-rich) materials, such as food scraps and grass clippings, and brown (carbon-rich) materials, such as dry leaves and shredded paper.
    * Keep the compost moist: The compost should be moist but not soggy.
    * Turn the compost regularly: This will help to aerate the compost and speed up the decomposition process

    """,

    "Recyclable Waste": """
